/* TO DO:

	- Create an array to hold the titles of your favorite movie *and* your partners' favorite movies.

	- Create an array with URLs for each movie poster. 
	  Note: Search Google Images for the movie title with "wiki" (i.e., "Mean Girls wiki") to find the official poster on Wikipedia.
	
	- Create an array with links to the HTML files for each movie page.
	  Note: Name each HTML file after the movie title (e.g., mean-girls.html). 
            Make sure your partners’ movie pages are live before adding links to their favorites.

	- Create an array to store each movie's rating (1 to 5). Try a different rating for each movie!
